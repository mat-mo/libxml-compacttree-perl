XML-CompactTree-XS

This module provides functions that use XML::LibXML::Reader to parse
an XML document into a tree formed of nested arrays (and hashes). It
aims to be very fast in doing that and to presreve all relevant
information from the XML (including namespaces, document order, mixed
content, etc.).

INSTALLATION

The module requires libxml2 library and header files to be installed
(e.g. libxml2 and libxml2-devel packages on most Linux distributions).
Build.PL attempts to obtain the compiler and linker flags for linking
against this library by calling xml2-config --cflags --libs. If this
tool does not come with your libxml2 installation, you may specify the
flags by hand, by setting the CFLAGS and LD_FLAGS environment
variables accordingly.

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
